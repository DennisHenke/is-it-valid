# is-it-valid

This is a code challenge I did for another company. The problem to solve was to conceptualize and implement a password component, which is configurable and reusable for multiple sites, in the timespan of three hours.

Due to the time constraint I used nextjs to get started to work on the problem immediately. The solution contains a backend and a frontend part, with the backend to provide different configurations for a password field via API endpoints, and the frontend to consume those API endpoints in a react password field component.
